===============

The svnfiltereddump tool is meant to extract portions of repositories of the
Subversion source control system. It's output can be loaded with Subversion's
"svnadmin load" command into a new Subversion repository. The source
repository must be given on the command line. A list of paths to extract
may given on command line or in one or more input file(s). It is also possible
to skip the revision history before a given starting revision.
